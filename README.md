# packet-block-placer

This mod allows players to place blocks via the PlayerInteractBlockC2SPacket and bypass all client-side checks that would prevent block placement.
Especially useful when playing against 1.8.9 servers using ViaFabricPlus, and you want to place a block inside your head for whatever reason.
